## Build instructions

Use the `make` tool for building scores. Specify one of the following **targets** to create:

* **Bassi** etc.: individual parts
* **parts**: all parts
* **movements**: all movements
* **score**: full score
* **all**: full score and all parts
* **archive**: ZIP file with all sources
* **info**: show all available targets

PDF files will be stored in a subfolder *./PDF*, MIDI files in a subfolder *./MIDI*.

The file *master.ly* allows you to work with an editor like Kile: Change the included movement/parts file in this script to generate files *Master.pdf* and *Master.midi*, which can be opened via the ViewPDF and OpenMIDI functionalities.
